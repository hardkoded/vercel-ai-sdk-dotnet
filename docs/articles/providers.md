# Providers

Native wire protocols have their own request mappers:

- Gateway (`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`) posts V4 call options to `/language-model`, `/embedding-model`, and `/image-model`.
- OpenAI speaks Chat Completions, the Responses API, embeddings, images, speech, and transcription.
- OpenAI Responses on GPT-6 and later models accept `reasoningEffortUpdate` (`none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`). Set it in the `openai` provider options to prepend a `configuration_update` item to the input. Set it on a `SystemModelMessage` with empty content (through its `providerOptions`) to place the update inside the conversation. Pass that message in the messages list. The `instructions` argument is rebuilt from text only and drops message provider options. Sampling parameters (`temperature`, `topP`) and `logprobs` follow the last update, so a `none` update on GPT-6 Sol or Luna keeps them. Adjacent updates, unsupported efforts, and message updates on other models throw `UnsupportedFunctionalityException`. A request-level update on an unsupported model is dropped with a warning.
- OpenAI Responses sends the `reasoningSummary` provider option (any string, such as `auto`, `concise`, or `detailed`; OpenAI validates it) as `reasoning.summary` on reasoning models, next to `reasoning.effort`.
- Anthropic speaks the Messages API. `AnthropicAwsProvider` points that body at the AWS external endpoint.
  - `claude-haiku-5-5` supports every effort level, including `xhigh`. It uses adaptive thinking and rejects thinking token budgets: `thinking: { type: "enabled", budgetTokens }` is sent as `{ type: "adaptive" }` with a warning, so use `effort` to control how much it thinks. Unlike `claude-sonnet-5-5`, thinking can be disabled, but only at `low`, `medium`, and `high` effort. At `xhigh` or `max` the effort is lowered to `high` with a warning. Structured output uses native `output_config.format`.
- Google speaks Gemini `generateContent`. `GoogleVertexProvider` changes the base URL and sends a bearer token.
- Azure OpenAI uses `api-key` and `/openai/deployments/{model}/chat/completions`.
- Amazon Bedrock signs a Converse request with Signature Version 4.
- Cohere speaks chat, embed, and rerank.
- OpenResponses posts to `{base}/responses`. The default base is the Gateway Open Responses route.
- Perplexity language generation posts to `{base}/v1/agent` (the Agent API). Preset ids are `fast`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`. Any other id is sent as an Agent API model id. Legacy Sonar model ids are not aliased, and Sonar provider options are not translated. Embeddings stay on the OpenAI-compatible embeddings route. Sonar PDF input, video input, and image or video results have no Agent API equivalent.

OpenAI-compatible providers (Alibaba, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Together, and the other chat wrappers) are thin wrappers over `Vercel.AI.OpenAICompatible`. They set the base URL, the provider id, and the environment variable. Perplexity embeddings use that client. Perplexity language generation uses the Agent API described above.

Speech, transcription, image, video, and Voyage each have a package that calls that provider’s public HTTP API. Use `SpeechModel`, `TranscriptionModel`, `ImageModel`, `VideoModel`, or `EmbeddingModel` rather than `LanguageModel`.

## Batch result downloads

`GatewayOptions`, `OpenAIOptions`, `AnthropicOptions`, and `GoogleOptions` each take an optional `BatchResultDownloads` setting. It configures the download of JSON Lines batch results. `provider.ExperimentalBatch()` returns the batch API whose `DoGetResultsAsync` reads them.

- **BatchResultDownloads** _BatchResultDownloads_

  Settings for downloading JSON Lines batch results. For Google, the setting applies to file-based results.

  - **MaxLineBytes** _int?_

    Maximum UTF-8 bytes per row, excluding the LF delimiter. Defaults to 64 MiB (67,108,864 bytes). Must be positive. Oversized rows throw a `DownloadError` and cancel the download.

```csharp
var anthropic = AnthropicProvider.Create(new AnthropicOptions
{
    BatchResultDownloads = new BatchResultDownloads { MaxLineBytes = 16 * 1024 * 1024 },
});
```

`JsonStreams.ReadJsonLinesAsync` takes the same limit as `maxLineBytes`, plus the `url` reported by the `DownloadError`.
